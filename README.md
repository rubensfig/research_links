# Research Links Emporium

Hello! This is a small repository where the on-going information about the phd work shall be published. Mostly to track the work that has been developed, such as links to presentations,
the papers I am following. I shall also be adding here the planning documents prepared during the course of the studies.

## Presentations

All links should be visible to everyone with the link, please let me know when that is not the case.

* [Next research steps](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nQrWBsNHM7JuzxKupqIy4x8VtmsP0BANBXUnKdnXWyY/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Intro stats](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QuUIis23fo33pzIOjXtRDluhpNCTnQwXt48LdimazRA/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Virtual function performance benchmarking](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p2yPKPnERp4iJ3NklOPqwXmV3SGJubUVlEqNP_cUGiY/edit?usp=sharing)
This presentation was prepared for the unrealized master student project for benchmarking the virtual functions. Maybe it can be reused at one point.
