	abstract = {Programmable network devices are on the rise with many applications ranging from improved network management to accelerating and offloading parts of distributed systems. Processor-based SmartNICs, match-action-based switches, and FPGA devices offer on-path programmability. Whereas processor-based SmartNICs are much easier and more versatile to program, they have the huge disadvantage that the resulting throughput may vary strongly and is not easily predictable even to the programmer. We want to close this gap by presenting a methodology which, given a SmartNIC program, determines the achievable throughput of this SmartNIC program in terms of achievable packet rate and bit rate. Our approach combines incremental longest path search with SMT checks to establish a lower bound for the slowest satisfiable program path. By analyzing only the slowest program paths, our approach estimates throughput bounds within a few seconds. The evaluation with our prototype on real programs shows that the estimated throughput guarantees are correct with an error of at most 1.7\% and provide a tight lower bound for processor- and memory-bottlenecked programs with only 8.5\% and 18.2\% underestimation.},

	abstract = {We investigate the use of SmartNIC-accelerated servers to execute microservice-based applications in the data center. By offloading suitable microservices to the SmartNIC's lowpower processor, we can improve server energy-efficiency without latency loss. However, as a heterogeneous computing substrate in the data path of the host, SmartNICs bring several challenges to a microservice platform: network traffic routing and load balancing, microservice placement on heterogeneous hardware, and contention on shared SmartNIC resources.We present E3, a microservice execution platform for SmartNIC-accelerated servers. E3 follows the design philosophies of the Azure Service Fabric microservice platform and extends key system components to a SmartNIC to address the above-mentioned challenges. E3 employs three key techniques: ECMP-based load balancing via SmartNICs to the host, network topology-aware microservice placement, and a data-plane orchestrator that can detect SmartNIC overload. Our E3 prototype using Cavium LiquidIO SmartNICs shows that SmartNIC offload can improve cluster energy-efficiency up to 3× and cost efficiency up to 1.9× at up to 4\% latency cost for common microservices, including real-time analytics, an IoT hub, and virtual network functions.},

	abstract = {Emerging 5G applications require a dataplane that has a high forwarding throughput and low processing latency, in addition to low cost and power consumption. To meet these requirements, the state-of-the-art 5G User Plane Functions (UPFs) are built over high performance packet I/O mechanisms like the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK), and further offload some functionality to programmable dataplane hardware. In this paper, we design and implement several standards-compliant UPF prototypes, beginning with a software-only DPDK-based UPF, progressing to designs which offload different functions to programmable hardware. We evaluate and compare the performance of these designs, to highlight the costs and benefits of these offloads. Our results show that offload techniques employed in prior work help improve performance in certain scenarios, but also have their limitations. Overcoming these limitations and fully realizing the power of programmable hardware requires offloading more complex functionality than is done today. Our work presents a preliminary implementation towards a comprehensive programmable dataplane-accelerated 5G UPF.},

However, such detailed monitoring can be very expensive especially for large-scale networks. To address such problem, inspired by thermodynamics, which uses the statistical characteristics of a large number of molecules’ motion but not each molecule’s trajectory for analysis, we propose the new concept of
              network temperature
              together with the notions of
              network-specific heat
              and
              network temperature gradient
              . Our approach does not only provide a statistical view of the current network state consisting of all the active packet paths at each time instant, but can be used to represent transitions among network states. Our network temperature-based methods have a broad applicability, such as to DDoS detection, dynamic node importance ranking, network stability and robustness evaluation, reliable packets routing, provenance compression assessment, and so on. Numerical and/or the experimental results show that our methods are effective.},

In addition, there is a lack of related studies with a special focus on wired networking. This paper aims at analyzing the impact of wired access networks in data network for greening the Internet, and encouraging further research in this field by clearly presenting the significance and reasonability of this endeavor. For this work, we first introduce the background and motivation of green networking. Next, we survey the existing works and describe reasonability of our approach, and then we estimate the overall energy consumption of wired access networks by which the energy consumption of data network is driven, calculate CO2 emissions and economic costs from the energy consumption and explore savings potential of them. Going a step, we analyze the impact of energy consumption, economy, and environment from the use of wired access network equipment depending on IP traffic types. Finally, we present a new viewpoint on energy efficiency focusing on the quality-of-service with future works related to this issue.},

	abstract = {Fifth generation (5G) and Beyond-5G (B5G) will be characterized by highly dense deployments, both on network plane and user plane. Internet of Things, massive sensor deployments and base stations will drive even more energy consumption. User behavior towards mobile service usage is witnessing a paradigm shift with heavy capacity, demanding services resulting in an increase of both screen time and data transfers, which leads to additional power consumption. Mobile network operators will face additional energetic challenges, mainly related to power consumption and network sustainability, starting right in the planning phase with concepts like energy efficiency and greenness by design coming into play. The main contribution of this work is a two-tier method to address such challenges leading to positively-offset carbon dioxide emissions related to mobile networks using a novel approach. The first tier contributes to overall power reduction and optimization based on energy efficient methods applied to 5G and B5G networks. The second tier aims to offset the remaining operational power usage by completely offsetting its carbon footprint through geosequestration. This way, we show that the objective of minimizing overall networks’ carbon footprint is achievable. Conclusions are drawn and it is shown that carbon sequestration initiatives or program adherence represent a negligible cost impact on overall network cost, with the added value of greener and more environmentally friendly network operation. This can also relieve the pressure on mobile network operators in order to maximize compliance with environmentally neutral activity.},

Specifically, we compare two state-of-the-art open-source NFV dataplanes, BESS and ClickOS, using commodity 10GbE NICs under various typical workloads. Our key observations are that (1) both dataplanes have performance issues processing small (≤128B) packets; (2) it is not always the best to colocate all VMs of a service chain on one server due to NUMA effect. We propose resource allocation strategies to remedy the problems, including carefully adding vNIC queues and CPU cores to vNFs, and distributing VNFs of a service chain to separate servers. To essentially address these problems and scale their performance, software dataplanes need to improve the support for NIC queues and multiple cores.},

	abstract = {Network Function Virtualization (NFV) replaces proprietary network appliances by softwarizing them in commodity servers and they are called as Virtual Network Functions(VNFs). As the network traffic changes dynamically, it is challenging to find the exact number of VNFs that can process the increase in demand. Moreover a VNF reconfiguration solution like migration or scaling has to be carefully chosen so that the increased traffic can be processed without violating the Quality of Service. We call this problem as VNF reconfiguration problem and provide an Integer Linear Programming formulation with implementation in CPLEX solver. From our simulations, we have concluded that our optimal formulation returns an efficient VNF embedding solution while reducing the reconfiguration costs. Scaling up VNFs are the most preferred choice but as the traffic increases significantly, scaling out VNFs are chosen more than other solution. Moreover our reconfiguration method has 30\% less reconfiguration cost compared to other methods.},

	abstract = {Roll-outs of 5G Mobile Packet Core (MPC) rely on principles and technologies of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). While the benefits of SDN and NFV in terms of flexibility are well-known, how to guarantee data plane performance for critical 5G services is less clear. Advances in programmable switch ASICs render an opportunity to offload data plane virtual network functions (VNFs) running on x86 servers to programmable hardware featuring strict performance guarantees. In this work, we present the design and performance evaluation of a critical element of 5G MPC, namely the virtual Evolved Packet Gateway (vEPG). We describe the P4-based uplink and downlink pipelines and evaluate a software and hardware implementation based on a Barefoot Tofino hardware switch, the ONOS controller, and P4Runtime support to manage match-action tables. The obtained results show that vEPG hardware implementation runs at line rate with low latency ({\textless}2 µs) and jitter, scaling up to 1.7 millions active users.},

	abstract = {Dramatic mobile data trafﬁc growth has spurred a dense deployment of small cell base stations (SCBSs). Small cells enhance the spectrum efﬁciency and thus enlarge the capacity of mobile networks. Although SCBSs consume much less power than macro BSs (MBSs) do, the overall power consumption of a large number of SCBSs is phenomenal. As the energy harvesting technology advances, base stations (BSs) can be powered by green energy to alleviate the on-grid power consumption. For mobile networks with high BS density, trafﬁc load balancing is critical in order to exploit the capacity of SCBSs. To fully utilize harvested energy, it is desirable to incorporate the green energy utilization as a performance metric in trafﬁc load balancing strategies. In this paper, we have proposed a trafﬁc load balancing framework that strives a balance between network utilities, e.g., the average trafﬁc delivery latency, and the green energy utilization. Various properties of the proposed framework have been derived. Leveraging the software-deﬁned radio access network architecture, the proposed scheme is implemented as a virtually distributed algorithm, which signiﬁcantly reduces the communication overheads between users and BSs. The simulation results show that the proposed trafﬁc load balancing framework enables an adjustable trade-off between the on-grid power consumption and the average trafﬁc delivery latency, and saves a considerable amount of on-grid power, e.g., 30\%, at a cost of only a small increase, e.g., 8\%, of the average trafﬁc delivery latency.},

	title = {Performance {Interfaces} for {Network} {Functions}},
	abstract = {Modern programmers routinely use third-party code, and infrastructure operators deploy software they did not write. This would not be possible without semantic interfaces—documentation, header files, specifications—that succinctly describe what that third-party code does. We propose performance interfaces as a way to describe a system’s performance, akin to how a semantic interface describes its functionality. We concretize this idea in the domain of network functions (NFs) and present a tool (PIX) that automatically extracts performance interfaces from NF implementations. We evaluate PIX on 12 NFs, including several used in production. The resulting performance interfaces are accurate yet orders of magnitude simpler than the code itself and take minutes to extract. We show how developers and operators can use performance interfaces to identify performance regressions, diagnose and fix performance bugs and identify the latency impact of NIC offloads. PIX is available at https://github.com/dslab-epfl/pix.},
